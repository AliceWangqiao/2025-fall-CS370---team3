  We met up and discussed what our program would have. 
  Tools have ID, type, checkedOut, jobsite, useTime, hoursUntilReplace, timeCheckedOut, whoHas, status. 
  Users have name, username, password, admin (which states whether or not they have an admin role).
  We also started discussing design.

  I assigned myself (Robert) to make prototypes of our program using an art app (seen in another folder).
  Qiao was assigned to work on the database since she was the only one taking a database class.  
  Jessica and Neha were assigned to work together on getTime, timePassed, and makeID.
